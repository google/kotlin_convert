# Java-to-Kotlin Conversion

This repository contains code for a basic Java-to-Kotlin source translator that
aims to preserve the original API as much as possible. It is intended to be used
in conjunction with other steps/tools as follows:

1. prepare code to be translated (e.g., by adding nullness annotations)
2. apply the translator
3. run an auto-formatter
4. apply improvements to make the code more typical (e.g., use `data` classes)

We don't currently provide any support for this repository, but you are welcome
to [contribute](docs/contributing.md).

This is not an officially supported Google product, and it is not affiliated
with either Oracle or the Kotlin Foundation.

The Java programming language was developed by Oracle.
